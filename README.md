## üéØ Project Guidelines

This project was completed as part of a practical exam with the goal of creating an original 3D scene. The guidelines were as follows:

1. **3D Modeling**:
   - Model several objects in the scene with a level of detail appropriate to their complexity.
   - Unwrap the UVs to correctly apply the textures.

2. **Evaluation Criteria**:

   | Criteria                        | Details                                                         |
   |----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Model complexity**             | Complexity and accuracy of each model                           |
   | **UV unwrapping**                | Quality and cleanliness of the UV unwrapping                    |
   | **Texturing**                    | Quality of the textures and their application to the objects     |
   | **Additional features**          | Animation, compositing, or any other additional functionality    |
